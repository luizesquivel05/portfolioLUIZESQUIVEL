        <div class="description">
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Luiz Esquivel, and I am a systems developer with a passion for creating innovative and efficient solutions. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work in various companies and projects, honing my skills and gaining experience in different areas of systems development.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began my journey as a Web Developer at Impacta Jovem Brasil, where I deepened my knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Working in this dynamic and challenging environment allowed me to develop front-end skills and learn how to create attractive and responsive interfaces, as well as back-end skills using technologies like Node.js and PHP.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I joined Inove Telecom as an IT Intern, where I had the opportunity to work on team-based system development projects. During this period, I improved my development and data skills and gained valuable knowledge in databases, especially SQL and SQL Server, working with efficient data storage and retrieval. Continuing my journey at Inove Telecom, I was promoted to Systems Development Analyst. In this role, I was responsible for leading development projects from conception to implementation and maintenance. I worked closely with business and IT teams to understand customer needs and translate them into robust and scalable software solutions. During my time at Inove Telecom, I also developed advanced skills in modern Business Intelligence (BI) tools, including Power BI. These skills allowed me to extract valuable insights from data and provide relevant information for strategic decision-making.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, I have had the opportunity to participate in significant projects. "Esquizando," a website I developed and maintain with care, demonstrates my passion for creating engaging web experiences. "Faculdade 05," another project where I put my back-end development knowledge into practice, allowed me to deepen my understanding of best practices in system architecture. One project I am particularly proud of is the "Sistema de Notas," a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) for grade calculations for teachers in different institutions. This project showcases my ability to create practical and efficient solutions using object-oriented programming and good software development practices. Furthermore, I developed the "Biblioteca LEsquivel05," a systems application with a graphical interface that utilizes a database to store the books I am reading. This project allowed me to enhance my GUI development skills and integration with databases, providing an intuitive experience for managing my personal library. Throughout these experiences, I have learned to work in teams, communicate ideas effectively, and tackle technical challenges creatively.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My passion for programming, combined with my fast learning ability, allows me to keep up with the latest industry trends and technologies. I am looking forward to continuing my journey as a systems developer, taking on new challenges, and contributing to the creation of innovative, secure, and efficient solutions.</p>
